### In this challenge, we began work on our first collaborative project of the FinTech Course. Our Challenge was to: 
>  ## 1) Analyze a Real-World FinTech Problem

> ## 2) Develop an Application that Solves said FinTech Problem 

### Our application, "Project: Hotspot", is the aggregator of several retail-centric market datapoints and translates them into Actionable Insights through comprehensive, script-driven Analysis.

#### The problem we analyzed and the corresponding FinTech Application we developed are deliverables that required us to mutually decide on the scope of our team's analysis. Our use case presents as follows...

### **PurpleSky** is a popular retail business establishment in San Francisco's bustling Mission District community.

Our utility, "Project HotSpot", is tasked with providing market intelligence and recommendations for PurpleSkyâ€™s next retail location, preferably located on Seattle's Eastside.

> **`GREAT NEWS!`** **PurpleSky**'s Executive Management has just received approval from their legal team and core investors to move forward with plans for the business's first satellite retail location. This will be a particularly challenging decision because the new location will be outside of California; in the **Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue MSA**. The Board has seen the work presented in our team's collective and individual **Github** repositories and they were eager to hire us for the job! Our objective was to employ critical market data to pinpoint the precise street and block that would make this new location as successful as the original.

Identifying retail locations where wealthy consumers converge, remain for a period of time, and are likely to spend money is a challenge for most decision makers considering the state of the present COVID Economy.

Analysis


assumptions:
    
    -> more yelp reviews means higher traffic
    
    -> the longer businesses stay in business means increased sense of community

**`CONGRATS!`** The team did such great work helping **PurpleSky** find their next location, the board has green-lit investment in *group-004'*s new FinTech consulting firm. We now have the resources to develop a commercial application of the program.py that will help other burgeoning cannabis dispensaries find that ideal location for their next store's location. Which will come in handy (and profitable!) with the imminent arrival of Federal decriminalization of cannabis use.
